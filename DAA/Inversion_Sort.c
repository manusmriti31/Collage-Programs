Three users in an online music portal listen to a playlist of 8 songs that are numbered from 1 to 8 in a random order.
Each user needs to be recommended to another user playlistâ€™s order that has minimum number of inversions. 
Design and implement an algorithm to determine the number of inversions. State the design strategy used and time complexity of the same.
