This subdirectory contains essential resources for the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** course, a fourth-year subject for circuit branches at MSRIT. Hereâ€™s what you will find:

- **Comprehensive Algorithm Implementations**: A collection of important algorithms implemented in the C programming language.

- **User-Friendly Code**: The code is structured for clarity and ease of understanding, making it accessible for students.

- **Graph Plotting Code**: Includes code snippets for plotting graphs using C.

- **Gnuplot Integration**: All graphs are generated using Gnuplot, so ensure that Gnuplot is installed and properly configured in your environment variables for seamless operation.

This organized collection aims to facilitate learning and provide practical coding experience in algorithm design and analysis.
